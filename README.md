# StateMachineGenerator-engine
Python engine to generate C++ state machine code from a textual description.

## How to use
1. Read and modify `blueprint.py` according to your statemachine design
2. `python3 generate.py`

Currently, the generated cpp code only supports one mode (OOP fashion). More modes will be added.

### TODO
- Add starting state option ?
- Add ending state option ?
- Add statechart option ?
